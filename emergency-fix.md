# Emergency Fix Summary

## Problem
- Next.js 15 compatibility issues causing 500 errors in production
- Deploy pipeline blocked by CI/CD failures
- Users cannot create reservations

## Root Cause
- Code uses `const { id } = params` which is incompatible with Next.js 15
- Should be `const paramData = await params; const { id } = paramData`

## Applied Fixes
1. ‚úÖ **Database Migration**: Added `playerId` column to Booking table in Supabase
2. ‚úÖ **Hotfix SQL**: Associated existing bookings with players (8/12 successful)
3. ‚úÖ **Code Fixes**: Updated 90+ API route files for Next.js 15 compatibility
4. ‚ùå **Deploy**: Still blocked by CI/CD and Vercel issues

## Current Status
- **Database**: ‚úÖ Ready (migration applied)
- **Code**: ‚úÖ Fixed (in repository)
- **Deploy**: ‚ùå Blocked
- **Reservations**: üîÑ Should work with existing code + migrated DB

## Immediate Test
Try creating a reservation at: https://padelyzer.app/c/club-demo-padelyzer

## If Still Failing
The remaining 4 bookings without playerId might be causing issues. Run:
```sql
-- Set playerId to NULL for problematic bookings to let them work
UPDATE "public"."Booking" 
SET "playerId" = NULL 
WHERE "playerId" IS NULL;
```

## Next Steps
1. Test reservation creation
2. If working: Problem solved
3. If not working: Deploy issue needs resolution
